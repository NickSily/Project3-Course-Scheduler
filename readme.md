# Functionality CSE Gator Planer

</sub> This program works with students to help them create the most optimal schedule

<sub> * for CSE major only * </sub> 

<sub> This repo runs the same program but with no SFML graphics and requires the user to input their options via 1> n courses displayed. We did this to ensure the program could function before making things more complicated. To refer to the repo with graphics please view it [here](https://github.com/BrianBFarias/Schedule-Chomper.git)

## Students are able to choose 

```
- Total number of semesters they desire to take
- Max number of credits per semester 
```

</sub> Upon filling up your schedule the program will run a topological sort to further optimize the program ideally allowing the user to be able to take less credits in the last semester/ have room for more classes.
